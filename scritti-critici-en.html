            <p>
                I have followed Evandro Muti’s work for years.
                He is young and in love with painting and graphic arts.
                As culture, he comes from the University of Architecture. He is a pure graphic artist; looking at his drawings you
                immediately think about the patient and sure work of a spider with its cobweb, and the lines of is compositions go
                towards infinite horizons.
                F.L.Lemaire, bready in 1957, has drawn geometric circles that we could link with Muti’s technique, like a game with
                spiral lines of an enormous elegance, but Muti is different from Lemaire for that sensation of unlimited space
                created by free lines in their jump instead of being closed in a circle. In 1949 Gabo drew incredible signs, they
                were magic, but closed in a form in the space too. We find the same situation in M.C.Escher, who is, in my opinion,
                the nearest to E.Muti.
                Muti has draun his coloured history, beginning with distemper since 1969, and bringing forward with methodic
                decision, good for his mental structure first of all as craftsman building the necessary spaces so that the
                light-colour to put on the cartoons doesn’t disperse outside his incredible dowels in a so wonderful accord.
                Vasarely tries to amaze with cerebralism, Muti tries to make you love his musicalism poetically chromatic…

                A coerent and clear sign shows the artist’s creative fantasy. Collage, graphic art and painting are the expressions
                of his art exhibition rich of known interests. A deep research in a world that makes part of culture and that
                belongs to the contemporary society.
                The tonal research in the painting, the sequence in the graphic art, the vital meetings in the collage are the
                peculiar attractives of his art exhibition that Muti has composed with accents that have roots in the magic of the
                colour and of the composition.

                You are visual operators, dedicated to the communication towards the biggest number: you can fragment your speech
                till the singularity of a certain moment and of a certain space.
                But this work of art has no value besides the organic insertion in your vision, in your speech: your environment
                structures take their roots from the deepest places of modern life, in men’s objective mind, contradictory but
                responsible of today.

                As an entomologist recognizes insects or an exorcist the devil, so we recognize the true painters, for the habit we
                have to meet always them.
                So we have recognized Evandro Muti, the artist with a pedigree, pleasant surprise in a not always stimulating
                parterre, where the true painters are rare swimmers in a very immense sea.
                We have to go deeply in Evandro’s paintings, like Mary Poppins did, because they are paintings where we must enter,
                enter and go out of them, and them re-enter and go out again because he shows incomes and dark galleries from which
                the light explodes outside into fragments and spares like from an atomic central or a cathode tube, like from a
                tunnel coming out from the centre of the earth. Evandro interiorises the light, then he digests it and later he
                spits it out as country fireworks or the city lights in black-out suddenly relighting. Evandro’s paint is nervous
                but it is reassuring at the same time because it is a pure painting with no dross, so that you can frame it and
                define it in time and space. From his first figurative geometric experiences as of metaphysic architectures,
                willingly compressed in only two dimensions when the post-pop exploded, Evandro paints not with the fourth dimension
                but, using Bergson’s words, “the fourth sensation”.
                <br>

                Changing colours, pungent, gay, objects presences that incarnate ideas and meanings, spaces without shadow inundated
                with blinding sunlight, metaphysical spaces that eliminate the logic of time, but also sensations of being fenced
                in, of separation, of loneliness, of looking inside oneself again.
                With his work Evandro Muti soar between the unforeseeable and the impenetrable sense of freedom associated with the
                adventurous idea of travelling towards a known, a journey that pulls, that burns life, endless tracks that spur the
                fantasy, where fragments of life assume the semblance of a different dimension, tracks that carry away and embody
                the will to live, short solitudes, small fears, moments of reflection and personal perceptions far away from the
                frenetical rhythm, meditations that unexpectedly occupy our space-time dimension giving space to a journey within
                the journey inside ourselves.
                <br>
                Then the artist deepens the human course of introspection but also of the unexplainable with his images of
                monumental but ethereal Doors of which one perceives the weight of the wood lightened by the use of a compact and
                emotional colour, reproductions loaded with meaning of an object that express a high level of poeticness; his neat
                Windows of decisive colours, that are reproduced here because of theie intense significance of being closed in and
                of standstill captivated by man.
                <br>
                It is a key to read his work that Evandro Muti imposes upon his admirers, a pleasing encounter with a non-strident
                chromatical and energetic palette, sometimes electrical, sometimes pastel, that never leaves the opportunity for
                indifference.
                Muti’s is an outlook on life that has a tendency towards the positive, where colours, the essence of his interior
                course, assume a primary rule, synthesize glimmers and fragments of things seen; a colour, Muti’s, defined in such a
                way as to eclipse the instinctive identification itself of the subject of the work, because his a colour that
                creates, that forms, that provokes intuitions.
                <br>
                Confronted with the mighty blue doors, demarcated by one single deep, lateral shadow, with the shutters so perfect
                and so detached as to not even allow the light to pass through the slats, imposed as an emblem of the division
                between physical and conceptual spaces, we suspend our pulsations.
                There exists some sort of progression in the shadows, from the presentation of a gray door that brings to mind the
                divisions and panels of old church doors, the most poetic of all, in which the shadows are barely hinted at and in
                which a delicate linear rhythm is predominant, going on to a blue door that reminds one instead of the huge drawing
                rooms of monumental houses that express a sense of closed-ness, and not by accident the painter inserts a small
                yellow square at the bottom almost as if to invite to look beyond; followed by the blue doors of ordinary houses in
                which both the traces of the shadows and the sense of separation between one environment and the next become more
                pronounced; doors that are more anonymous but also more abstract, in hues of brown that only in appearance seem
                easier to pass.
                <br>
                Doors and Windows, common objects of everyday life from times immemorial, in the framework of this exposition are
                translated as a symbolical demarcation line between the interior and the exterior, as a barrier bet ween one
                environment and another, almost as if to separate the “I” from the world, the being and its self; these are a basic
                premise for Muti, a microcosm from which an interminable series of fantasies about the known and the unknown unwind;
                an alternating between see and know, hear and remember, between emotions and joys of the past and the present, they
                are most of all a confrontation with an unforeseen psychological situation using thought to “go” beyond. And then
                our eyes wander from the vivacious, decisive hues to observe the essential lines for a construction of space that is
                airless and scalding, so blinding as to be perceived as unreal; they are the Shuttered Windows. Muti interprets this
                subject in a varied way and with various hues, they are shutters that although they present one single lateral
                shadow, considerably expand the impossibility to see beyond, even though they have pleasant colours like red they
                express with force the division of the environments and thus the painter determines a gradual increase in emotional
                tension that unleashes the imagination and deepens the reflection. His is an enigmatic and ironic invitation so much
                so that some images of shutters can be mistaken for those of the doors, almost as if some sort of mutation between
                one object and the other were in progress. In one of them appears a completely illusional tense blue sky far from
                being reflected in the large lateral glass, glass that is not transparent and seems solid like construction
                material.
                <br>
                The most emblematical window/door is the red one however which attracts the observer to itself with self-assurance
                and that then with equal audacity manifests its being an element of closure from the outside towards the inside and
                vice versa.
                <br>
                Each one of us will see beyond, each one will perceive the colours, smells spaces and environments in a different
                way, and herein lies the interest of these works, it is in fact in this play of personal and introspective analysis
                that we arrive at estranging ourselves, keeping in mind only the purity of the colour, the lines, in substance the
                art it is we and the works, it is we and the colours, we are by now completely carried away, we are inside the work,
                to discover its mysteries, intimate perceptions that come up freely without being deciphered, intriguing thoughts
                that space without aim and follow the movement of old iron models om the tracks, decorated by the brilliant colours
                of Muti.
                <br>
                They are fragments and parts of old trains, trains seen as a child that remained in the collective imaginarium,
                trains that in their physical inconsistency represent an unusual way to continue a journey already undertaken. And
                again it is the alternation between the empty and the full, the outside and the inside, the carriages of the train
                that make our fantasy and our most intimate desire for freedom travel are stimulants for the eye, with their primary
                colours with their black lines, with their metal bolts highlighted, that wait to be re-brought to life by human
                stories; in the analysis of the compositions the presence of gray and black windows and barred doors that
                determinate a sense of waiting mixed with abandonment jump as a matter of fact to the eye. And to think instead that
                the train is by metonymy, in the collective imaginarium, a pre-figuration of letting go, a way to slip away with our
                thoughts towards those landscapes that accompany us on our journey, a journey that may be physical or internal, and
                making the space-time dimension evolve from static to raging.
